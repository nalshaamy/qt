/** @odoo-module **/

/*
 * A tiny holder for POS services that model records cannot reach on their own.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The on-premise module shows the qty-lock warning with
 * `this.pos.notification.add(...)` from inside PosOrderline.setQuantity(). That
 * throws: model records are Proxies that expose `models`, `config` and `session`,
 * but **not** `pos` and **not** `env`. Core never writes `this.pos` on a record on
 * either platform, 19.0 included, so the on-premise call is broken there too.
 * Verified on a live database,
 * where `line.pos`, `order.pos`, `line.env` and `order.env` are all undefined and
 * the numpad raised
 *   TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'notification')
 * which surfaces to the cashier as Odoo's generic "Oops!" dialog.
 *
 * PosStore does have the service, so it publishes it here once at startup and the
 * model patches read it back. Kept deliberately minimal: this is a bridge for a
 * missing back-reference, not a place to accumulate global state.
